# Finite-state Machine on Arduino

This is a really simple Arduino program to exemplified how a finite-state machine works on it.

For this, you'll use just 4 push buttons, one arduino uno (or any other arduino of you preference), jumpers and a breadboard.

The circuit is designed and shown in the "*Circuit_Image.JPG*" file.
